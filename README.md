# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This repository corresponds to the Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project, which generates tidy data from Samsung Galaxy S accelerometers data.

### Prerequisites

The run_analysis.R script works with a file in ./data/UCI_HAR_Dataset.zip (within a "data"" folder at the level of the script) or it tries to connect to the internet to retrieve the file.  Make sure a connection to the internet is possible, in the latter case

## Running the tests

Simply run the script and it will get the data, unzip it and tidy it.  Two files are generated as a result, both will be saved at ./data/tidydata
